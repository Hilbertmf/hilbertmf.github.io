          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>The World Surf League (WSL) is the governing body for professional surfers
            and is dedicated to showcasing the world’s best talent in a variety of 
            progressive formats. The World Surf League was previously known as the 
            Association of Surfing Professionals (ASP) from 1983 to 2014. The 
            organization was founded in 1976 by Fred Hemmings and Randy Rarick.</p>
          <p>In 2013, the ASP was acquired by ZoSea, backed by Paul Speaker, Terry 
            Hardy, and Dirk Ziff. At the start of the 2015 season, the ASP changed 
            its name to the World Surf League (WSL). Sophie Goldschmidt was appointed 
            as WSL CEO on July 19, 2017. Paul Speaker had stepped down as CEO on January
            11, 2017, and Dirk Ziff acted as the interim WSL CEO until Goldschmidt's
              appointment.</p>

          <h2>Predecessors</h2>
          <p>1964 to 1972, International Surfing Federation (ISF) held the World 
              Surfing Championships as a single event every two years and was open to 
              all comers.</p>
          <p>1973 to 1975, Smirnoff World Pro-Am Surfing Championships, occasionally 
            referred to as the de facto professional world championship because the 
            International Surfing Federation had been unable to establish a format 
            or sponsorship so no official amateur championships were held between 
            1973 and 1975.</p>
          <p>1976 to 1982, International Professional Surfers (IPS) was the original 
            world governing body of professional surfing.</p>
          <p>The predecessors of the WSL relates to what organization predominantly 
            represented individual professional surfers at that time. This is an 
            important point because the International Surfing Federation (ISF) still 
            functions to this day as the International Surfing Association (ISA) and 
            also refers to competition winners as world champions (or variants 
            thereof).</p>

                perspective does that mean anything to you at this point in time?" he 
                replied "No, not at all, I'm just happy he's alive."</dd>
